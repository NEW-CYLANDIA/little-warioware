# Contributing

We tend to consider contributions on two different levels: microgame contributions and core
contributions.  
The former are self-contained and should be able to be added/removed from the
project without impacting the rest of the game.  
The latter are more in-depth modifications to the
inner-workings of the game. They'll be under a little more scrutiny than microgame contributions.  

In general, this is a collaborative effort, so be **considerate** of other's work. In most cases,
your contributions should be **additive** instead of wiping down someone else's efforts.

## Microgame contributions

## Core contributions

Before starting, make sure to read the [style guide](style_guide.md) document. If you intend to
work on something large or important, opening an [issue](https://github.com/NEW-CYLANDIA/little-warioware/issues)
to make people aware of it is a good idea.  

The important thing here is **accessibility**. We want the codebase to be readable and
understandable by most people. To this end:
- Document your code with **useful** comments.
- Avoid complexity for the sake of complexity. A simple and targeted solution is better than a
  generic but complex one.
- When in doubt, stick to the most explicit way of doing things.

When opening your PR, try to write a description of what it does and how it does it. Be **patient**,
and do **not** up your contribution with comments because it is not processed swiftly enough for
you. You should also think twice before explicitely tagging a specific person in a PR or comment.
