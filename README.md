# Little Warioware (working title)

### [Playable build on itch.io](https://iznaut.itch.io/little-warioware)
(password is `newcylandia`)

## What is this?
Little Warioware is an open-source clone of [Nintendo's WarioWare series](https://www.mariowiki.com/WarioWare_(series)), in which players must survive a gauntlet of randomized "microgames" (games with a simple objective and a time limit of less than 10 seconds).

If you haven't played WarioWare before, I recommend checking out some longplay videos on Youtube: https://youtu.be/XLg1zLXTnL0?t=168

The goal with this project is not to make a 1:1 reproduction of the original games, but to provide a framework for playing microgames and allowing _anyone_ to create their own microgames. Also, **crediting and discovery will be a primary focus** - the dream is to make a system in which you can easily bookmark microgames you enjoyed and trace the creators back to their external social media or portfolio sites.

In short - I want to give WarioWare the [Little Mario](https://github.com/a-little-org-called-mario/a-little-game-called-mario) treatment!

## How can I help?
Microgame contributions are always welcome, but there's still a lot of core system work that needs to be hammered out as well. There are a number of pieces I would like to be firmly in place before making this project fully public and open to submissions. I will try to keep the [Issues page](https://github.com/iznaut/little-warioware/issues) updated - anything there is work that needs to be done and I could likely use all the help I can get!

## Resources
At some point I will formalize the rules and guidelines for making microgames and contributing, but for now I'm just going to point to the incredible wealth of resources available on MarioWiki:

- [Microgame](https://www.mariowiki.com/Microgame) - An overview of how a microgame is designed  
- [List of WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$ microgames](https://www.mariowiki.com/List_of_WarioWare,_Inc.:_Mega_Microgame$!_microgames) - An exhaustive list of all 213 microgames from the original WarioWare, each with its own dedicated wiki page with gameplay descriptions and screenshots  
- [WarioWare D.I.Y.](https://www.mariowiki.com/WarioWare:_D.I.Y.) - An overview of Nintendo's own attempt at a WarioWare that includes tools for user-generated content (a stretch goal for this project would be to similarly include tools that make it easy for non-programmers to create microgames!)

You can also read my [more rambly notes on Notion](https://iznaut.notion.site/Little-Warioware-c289be2b77fe4b478a5bf1ad66cef8b5), if you really want to.
